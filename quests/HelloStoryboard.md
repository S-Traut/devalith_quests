# Hello, Storyboard!

Welcome to the storyboard guild! This quest is a bit special, its goal is to explain you how the quest system will work during your journey. So first of all, what exactly is a quest in the Devalith Guild?

A quest is working kinda similar as an RPG game, you have a goal, and once you complete it you'll get rewarded by EXP and your activity decay will be reset.

- To complete a quest you have to be a member of the guild
- You can only resolve a quest 1 time
- There will be multiple levels of quests, the hardest it is, the more exp you'll get
- You cannot group to resolve a quest, however, you can ask for help
- You can use whatever you want to resolve the quests, the only thing that you'll need to send, is a .osb file.

## How to beat a quest

In the **#quests** channel there is a list of the most recently added quests to the system, those will contain a link to a markdown lesson of this repository, which, will contain all the details about the quest. You will also encounter some quests during your lessons or exercices, those will be the most adapted to your current skills and learning curve.

Once you've got your quest, you have few things to do:

- First, take the unique ID of the quest, this is what you'll use to send the answer to the bot
- Read the quest tasks, and create a new storyboard (any map / song will work)

Once you are done with the tasks, you can take you .osb file, and send it to the bot, by PM with the ID of the quest, just drop the file into the private message and type:

`!resolve <unique_id>`

The bot will read your message, read your .osb file, parse it and run a bunch of tests on it to see if it resolve the quest problems correctly.

If your osb file is VALID the bot will send you a success message, telling you how many EXP you've got.

If your osb is NOT VALID the bot will send you an error message, giving you the exact reasons why your osb file is not passing all the tests.
